Datamining final project.

Project Title: Determining External Factors Responsible for High Risk Cashiers in A Safeway Store

Description: In this project, we intend to determine external factors that may control the risk factor
of the cashier in the Safeway store. The given Safeway cashier risk report identifies the risky cashiers based on the factors such as total number of transactions, coupon usages, refunds, item voids count, base average bag size etc. And here we try to identify external factors (if any) which may determine or identify the risky cashier. We observed the Safeway cashier report carefully and then it was assessed that few stores have high number of risky cashiers. We considered and researched the external factors such as the population of the city, house hold income of the city and the cashier’s salary, which may influence or control the risk factor of the cashier. We collected the city data by the web scraping, cashier’s salary using the Indeed API and analyzed the collected data using the decision tree. This would be helpful for Safeway to identify high risk stores (stores having more number of high risk cashiers) depending upon the above mentioned external factors
